# Maintain a running count of days, hours, minutes, and seconds until some
# specific date and time. Usage:
#
# countdown.sh "date/time string"
#
# The date/time string is parsed by the 'date' utility, and can be any format
# that utility understands. FOr example:
#
# countdown.sh "dec 18 2024 4:00pm"
#
# Don't forget the quotes around the date/time string. Note that this script
# assumes conventional Linux terminal handling of \r and \n -- it might not
# work with a serial terminal.

# We end up with TARGET_EPOCH as the target date in seconds since
